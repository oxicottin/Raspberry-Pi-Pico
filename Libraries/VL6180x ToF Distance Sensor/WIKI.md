INTRODUCTION
The STMicroelectronics VL6180X Time of Flight Ranging Sensor embeds ST’s patented FlightSense™technology that allows distance to be accurately measured independent of target reflectance. The sensor is rated to perform ranging measurements of 5-100mm, but it can provide readings up to 200mm in a good environment. Besides, VL6180X is also equipped with an ambient light sensor, so basically, this is a sensor that combines proximity ranging and ambient light level measurement capacities into a single package.
